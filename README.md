# CloudLift-Agent
CloudLift Agent is an AWS Bedrock AgentCore–powered migration copilot that parses on-prem inventory, proposes target AWS architectures with cost estimates, generates Terraform, and orchestrates a dry-run migration workflow (provision → validate → report) via Step Functions. It’s reproducible, auditable, and designed for safe, low-cost demos.
